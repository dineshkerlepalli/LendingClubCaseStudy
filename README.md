## General Information
- You work for a consumer finance company Lending Club which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.

- Objective is to identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
